MBTA Red Line Project
Jack O'Shea
October 20, 2016

This project is a webpage that uses Google Maps APIs to display 
information about the Red Line.

It places red markers at each Red Line stop, all connected with a red line that traces the route of the Red Line. Clicking on any one of these markers opens an infowindow with a sorted list of the trains on their way to that stop with their destinations and ETAs.
A blue marker is placed at the user's current location, along with a blue line connecting that marker and the nearest station. Clicking this marker displays an infowindow with the name of closest station and its' distance in miles from the user.

Completion Time: ~5 hours
