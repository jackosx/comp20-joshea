Responsive Homer CSS
Author: Jack O'Shea
Date: September 25, 2016

This page animates a 4 frame Homer cartoon as the browser window shrinks.
It achieves this through CSS media queries and sprite sheets.
The sprite sheet is one image that contains a frame of Homer in each quadrant.
The media queries make the "homer div" display a different portion of the
sprite sheet as the window's width decreases by modifying background styles.
