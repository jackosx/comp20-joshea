##What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
One of the biggest advantages to using this repo is that we get to use an established industry standard to store and keep track of our work instead of the silly homework server! It's more reliable overall, has better version control than whatever that "snapshot" thing on the homework server is, and while using it we get better at a tool used by professionals. It's also useful for getting/saving our semester's work at the end!

##What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was easily the MBTA assignment because it was the first time I got to show people at home what I'm working on in school and excitedly say, "Look what I did!" 

##What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
While I obviously learned a lot about web programming in this course (as expected), I was surprised by how much I learned to love git, especially through the final project. I've made many small/mystery project-breaking changes while working on past apps and other little projects, and subsequently wasted many hours (and sometimes even days) trying to fix them. As the size and complexity of our final project grew I learned to commit and branch frequently. I thought I broke our server once, and no amount of Command-Zing could fix it. Luckily, I had commited recently and averted crisis by using git to revert the project. Also, prior to this class I didn't have much experience collaborating on comp projects. I didn't really know how collaboration would work logisitically, but working on our group project showed me git is also a pretty good way to achieve that! 

Another thing I appreciated was the emphasis on basic security principles, such as "never trust user input."

##How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I think I've made leaps and bounds of progress throughout this semester. Again, while I learned a lot about Web Programming, I think the bulk of my growth happened because this course threw me into situations more like working in industry than other courses have. I would like to reiterate that prior to this course I didn't know how to approach collaboration in a professional manner. Developing this skill is crucial for making any use of other CS skills outside of class. I feel like this semester pushed me towards being a professional programmer more than any other Comp course I've taken.

##Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I'm pretty excited to take Security next fall.
